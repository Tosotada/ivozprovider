#####################
Concurrent call limit
#####################

This mechanism **limits the number of external calls** of each client/brand.

It can be configured at two levels:

- At Brand level with **Max calls** setting.

- At Client level with **Max calls** setting.

A brand clients *Max calls* sum may be bigger than brand's *Max calls* value, there is no control to avoid this situation.

.. warning:: This counters are independent. Whenever one of this counter reaches its limit, call will be denied. This
               means that a call from a client that has not exceeded it own *Max call* setting may be denied if brand's
               limit has been exceeded.

There are two independent counters for each entity (brand/client):

- **KamUsers counter**: counts client generated calls (incoming calls from client to KamUsers only).

- **KamTrunks counter**: counts received external calls for a given client (incoming calls from DDI Provider to KamTrunks only).

.. tip:: To disable this mechanism, set its value to 0.

.. rubric:: Brand max calls to 0, client max calls to 5

This client may have 10 concurrent calls, divided into:

- 5 calls generated by its users.

- 5 calls to their DDIs.
